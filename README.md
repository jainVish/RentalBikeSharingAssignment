* we can see the relation among temp, atemp, hum, windspeed, cnt. Hence, we can go for prediction using linear regression model.
* We can see, Linear trends relation is showing among independent categorical variables and target variable cnt.
* The model's p-value < 0.05 and ViF < 5 are in acceptable range. We can say out model follow linear regression rules. 
* We got the error normalized.
* The predicted values have linear relationship with the actual values.
* The error graphs are normally distributed.
* The residual is not showing any covariance.
* Residucals are homoscedasticity.
* Residucals mean is zero.
